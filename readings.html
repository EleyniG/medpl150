  <h2>Susan Sontag's On photography</h2>
  <p> Photographs are proof that something once existed or happened, making them an act of certification. Sontag maintains this idea that cameras are more than just capturing light, but rather help to grant validity and authority to the event being recorded. At the beginning of the essay, Sontag affirms this idea when she states that photography is a way of experiencing reality, but vicariously. The idea of ​​digital over-documentation has resonated greatly with me, since if there is an event or trip in real life, we usually take photos, not only as a souvenir, but as Sontag said, this validates this moment, certifying our presence and the experience of the moment, for me, attesting to my presence.
A classic case in point is Plato's cave, where the inmates are mixing up shadows with reality. The vast majority of my life and that of the subsequent generation is spent through the digital shadow we project. I might not have ten thousand photos in a ballroom, but my album has photos of flawlessly filtered sunsets, plates of food, or static landscapes that never look as good in real life. My phone's camera does not only capture reality; it makes it into evidence that "I was there," making the experience property, something belonging to me.
Sontag would call the act of photographing an activity of acquiring and taming the world. This becomes evident when I am traveling somewhere or looking at sunsets. When I arrive at a beautiful overlook or look at sunsets from a city park, my first instinct is not to sniff the air or absorb the view, but to take out my phone and get in position. I'm more concerned about composition and what that photo will look like on my Instagram page than with how the wind or the noise of the folks I am with will feel. Photography unconsciously becomes a ritual of interruption, as it prioritizes the moment to document it, and by interrupting it, it abandons the flow or experience of the moment. This creates a sense of emotional detachment, where documenting the experience is better or more important than living it. We are left without the fairy tale of life. Time passes, and I continue to miss it without even realizing many times.
This mediation of the real is one with a decision within it, Sontag's "grammar" of photography: the decision to include, and importantly exclude. The gourmet photograph of food I uploaded on my story omits the restaurant's horrid lighting, the shaky table, or the stilted conversation that preceded the shot. What one publishes is always an oversimplification. Photography is not a falsehood because it alters what was, but because it selects what should be. It's a benign lie, creating a more vibrant memory that is my official account of what transpired, frequently replacing the normal memory in my own mind and changing the true story.
Apart from personal experience, Sontag is talking about how photography can make the exotic normal and deaden our senses to horror. It is how filters and constant editing deaden our eyes to "raw" beauty that I understand this in a joking way. Unedited is not as valuable. The upshot is that we live within a loop where reality is always on the back foot, attempting to catch up with its more sophisticated digital equivalent. Finally, Sontag asks us to ask ourselves: Are we building memory or simply building evidence for the future? My experience of scrolling through my gallery is that often the picture becomes the thing, and the memory, the shadow. </p>
