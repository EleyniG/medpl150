  <h2>Homework 2 </h2>
  <h3>Susan Sontag's On photography</h3>
  <p>Photographs are proof that something once existed or happened, making them an act of certification. Sontag maintains this idea that cameras are more than just capturing light, but rather help to grant validity and authority to the event being recorded. At the beginning of the essay, Sontag affirms this idea when she states that photography is a way of experiencing reality, but vicariously. The idea of ​​digital over-documentation has resonated greatly with me, since if there is an event or trip in real life, we usually take photos, not only as a souvenir, but as Sontag said, this validates this moment, certifying our presence and the experience of the moment, for me, attesting to my presence.
A classic case in point is Plato's cave, where the inmates are mixing up shadows with reality. The vast majority of my life and that of the subsequent generation is spent through the digital shadow we project. I might not have ten thousand photos in a ballroom, but my album has photos of flawlessly filtered sunsets, plates of food, or static landscapes that never look as good in real life. My phone's camera does not only capture reality; it makes it into evidence that "I was there," making the experience property, something belonging to me.
Sontag would call the act of photographing an activity of acquiring and taming the world. This becomes evident when I am traveling somewhere or looking at sunsets. When I arrive at a beautiful overlook or look at sunsets from a city park, my first instinct is not to sniff the air or absorb the view, but to take out my phone and get in position. I'm more concerned about composition and what that photo will look like on my Instagram page than with how the wind or the noise of the folks I am with will feel. Photography unconsciously becomes a ritual of interruption, as it prioritizes the moment to document it, and by interrupting it, it abandons the flow or experience of the moment. This creates a sense of emotional detachment, where documenting the experience is better or more important than living it. We are left without the fairy tale of life. Time passes, and I continue to miss it without even realizing many times.
This mediation of the real is one with a decision within it, Sontag's "grammar" of photography: the decision to include, and importantly exclude. The gourmet photograph of food I uploaded on my story omits the restaurant's horrid lighting, the shaky table, or the stilted conversation that preceded the shot. What one publishes is always an oversimplification. Photography is not a falsehood because it alters what was, but because it selects what should be. It's a benign lie, creating a more vibrant memory that is my official account of what transpired, frequently replacing the normal memory in my own mind and changing the true story.
Apart from personal experience, Sontag is talking about how photography can make the exotic normal and deaden our senses to horror. It is how filters and constant editing deaden our eyes to "raw" beauty that I understand this in a joking way. Unedited is not as valuable. The upshot is that we live within a loop where reality is always on the back foot, attempting to catch up with its more sophisticated digital equivalent. Finally, Sontag asks us to ask ourselves: Are we building memory or simply building evidence for the future? My experience of scrolling through my gallery is that often the picture becomes the thing, and the memory, the shadow.

 <h4>Homework 4</h4>
 <h5>Nesrine  Malik </h5>
<p> Nesrine Malik's essay, more a groan of horror than analysis or critique, is at the terrifying ease with which human beings have lost the mooring of reality and allowed themselves to be carried on the tide of cybernetics. It causes us to see how we have replaced the fullness of preparation by its liquidity and its constant false imitations. The "AI trash" is the new River Lethe whose virtual waters we drink to forget the distinction between what is felt and what only generated. No longer is the camera distorting and chopping, as Sontag puts it, but the algorithm which mass beat around the bushwith the force of the witness's testimony that never was. We are beset on all sides by a second wave of images, an persistent flood in which reality is flood by the glamour of make believe.
</p>
<p>The tragedy is not lies themselves, but the democratization of propaganda. The craft of persuasion, once reserved, is now a tailor made deluge of political fantasy and ideological longing. AI trash gives us ideal simulations of the past, "traditional wife," good political narrative, that legitimize our deepest prejudices. And that's because AI isn't a blank slate, it's pre-trained on a warped mirror internet already by things that already exist. Out of this skewed origin comes content that is not novel, but "structurally conservative," roma  nticizing an unreal world but giving the desire for order and hierarchy. 
 </p>
<p>The psychological effect of this saturation is one of stasis, the actual tragedy seething in the backrooms while we "sleepwalk." When reality photographs of war, suffering, or dictatorship become entwined with our credulous vision, our pictorial vocabulary is stultified. The effect of a bombing is as real as a gigantic cartoon cat.
  </p>
 <p> The feedback loop is perverse, the more control it has over us, the more the algorithm gives us more than it says or keeps us sane. It commits us to a subjective echo chamber, especially through closed systems such as WhatsApp, where the artificial surface is set bare for display. Power is transmitted directly from technology to receiver, and the subject is received more by subjective objects than objective fact.
  </p>
<p> Malik makes us question the most immediate concern, how is collective will supposed to function when our urgency has been abated? It is not a matter of not knowing anymore, but of not being able to feel reality. Rogue AI provides us with aesthetic consolation that distracts us from the cracks of the real world. Finally, this wave distorts not just what we can perceive, but it suppresses our ability to react, and the world is driven towards tragedy as we remain seated in a trance, under the spell of the hyperreal specter that surrounds us.
