  <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
 <p> You enter the New York subway system a few minutes before midnight.
The station is practically deserted, and the stillness gives the impression that it has been waiting for something.
The lights begin to flicker, and you are momentarily undecided whether to go on or return.</p>

 <p> You are standing on the platform.
A train pulls up slowly, but it has no numbering or destination.
Across the tracks, a metal door opens into a black tunnel that, surprisingly, you’ve never noticed before.</p>
