  <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>In this first collage for assignment 4, my intent was to expose the painful disconnection of humanity from the surrounding crisis. It shows individuals, including those in historical dress, absorbed by their screens, creating a veil of digital indifference that seems to negate the devastation. This visual contrast underlines how the virtual has become more urgent and real than the collapse of our environment. Then in homework 5 I add the red and white lines running across the top as a pattern, evoking a flag, represent the overwhelming force of a system, nation, or power that envelops and is perhaps responsible for the destruction. More precisely, the white lines act as a blinding light or symbolic intervention-a scream or abrupt rupture that tries to pierce through that technological bubble and create immediate awareness.</p>
