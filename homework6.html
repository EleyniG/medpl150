  <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>In Motherhood in Crisis, the story that caught my attention the most was that of Kadiatu, The Grieving Mother. It is her story of the pain and danger that most women face in Sierra Leone during childbirth. What stood out most to me within this story was how illustration, rather than only photos, depicted it. This almost made the reader feel the emotions that she experienced more deeply the sadness, her fear, and her strength. The illustrations show things a photograph cannot: what it feels like to lose a child, or to continue walking even as there's no help in sight. The soft colors and the faces make the story more personal and emotional.</p>
  
 <p>I think illustration was also done out of respect. In a situation as painful as Kadiatu's, real photos may feel too invasive or hard to look at. The drawings give some distance but still keep the story powerful. They make us think about the person, not just the image. It's a more sensitive way to show loss and lets the viewer focus on her experience without feeling like they're watching something too private.
The mix of text, illustration, and photography makes this story very strong. The photos remind us that these experiences were lived by real people and in real places, while the illustrations allow us to travel further and feel emotions that highlight the events. Personally, I believe that the text alone wouldn't have been able to capture the emotional magic. The combination of images and words complements each other, bringing this story to life. You can almost feel the silence, every moment of waiting, and the anguish the victim must have felt.
</p>
  
 <p>In conclusion, the illustrations helped bring this story to life because they help us feel part of the story and share in that feeling of fear, anguish, and more. They manage to convey an emotional truth that is often hidden behind statistics and news reports. We relate to people who have to live through a problem rather than just reading about it.</p>
