<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>For this assignment, we had to illustrate a real environment using Adobe Illustrator. I chose this image because, well, I am genuinely drawn to minimalist homes; the simplicity seems peaceful, intimate, and emotionally honest. To me, minimalism isn't just an aesthetic; it speaks of living free from excess noise in a quiet and deeply personal way, like having a conversation without all the extra noise. I wanted the illustration to somehow reflect that closeness and serenity, like inviting someone into a safe inner space. While creating this image, I sought to focus on capturing a sense of serenity through shapes and colors, rather than simply replicating the architecture itself. After finishing the final details, I remembered why I appreciate minimalism so much; how I can visually perceive warmth, identity, and tranquility all at once is what captivates me about this art form.</p>
