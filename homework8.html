<h2>Reflection</h2>

 <p>For task 8, we were assigned to create two GIFs. The first involved making the eye from task 6 blink, and the second involved taking or finding a photograph and making the person move; in this case, I used a cartoon character. To make the eye blink, I had to create a new eye since my Illustrator design was too complex to perform that action. After finishing and before pasting it, I created different eyelids so that, when imported into Photoshop, it would appear as if the eye was blinking. Once pasted, I resized it correctly. I also made sure that each eyelid was on its own layer. Then, I was able to place the layers on the timeline to make the eye blink. For the second GIF, I had to experiment with several images, and although I initially had one idea, I ended up choosing an animated cartoon of Omer Simpson. I used the puppet warp tool to create different versions of his leg and head movement in various positions. I selected the person's feet, knees, shoulders, one elbow, and hands and manipulated them to create different positions. Then, I layered the different versions and placed them on the timeline. This allowed me to create the illusion of the cartoon character moving their leg up and down and their head from side to side. This task was undoubtedly the most difficult so far. Not only because of creating a new eye and discovering new tools and strategies, but also because for GIF two, I had to change images a few times since it was often difficult to manipulate the movement the way I wanted.</p>
