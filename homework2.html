<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>For these photos, I used a highly saturated cyan/blue-green filter, which gives the entire scene a cold, intense, and almost monochromatic look. This filter makes bright white objects, like in image two, turn a deep blue-green, significantly altering the original colors. I really enjoyed this project, and it was interesting to play with the tones to give the images some kind of feeling.</p>
