<h1>Eleyni Garcia</h1>
  
 <p>Eleyni Garc√≠a is a creative who seeks to experiment with the art of
   human connections through expression. Garcia created this space with the aim of transcending
   the digital and physical realms and seeking a connection that can generate new opportunities to understand and narrate human experiences. 
   Her work seeks to focus on a more intimate relationship between the body, memory, and the visual to address issues between the public and the private. 
   Garcia's goal was to create a space where questioning, perception, and sensitivity intersect, and this was made possible through an artistic language that combines visual,
   sound, and performance. </p>
