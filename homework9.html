  <h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>Homework 9 involved gathering data on personal study habits and using it as a visual in an Adobe Illustrator project. The project involved designing a Google Form that consisted of two questions about how many hours a day individuals study and what method of studying works best for them in order to retain information. A total of 14 responses were gathered.
The data showed 50% of students study for 3-4 hours per day, 35.7% stated that they only study before taking exams, and a smaller group of students studies for 1-2 hours. On the topic of note-taking techniques, handwriting notes was deemed most effective with 50% of students favoring it.
With all of this data, I then used Illustrator to input this data using the Pie Graph Tool. I was able to customize this graph by using my own coloring scheme so that it would be easy to identify which category of studies I was looking at. To help identify all of this data, I also used icons.</p>
