  <h2>Reflection</h2>

 <p>Homework 3 used my own photo of Hunter College hallway to explore how focus changes not just what we see, but how a moment feels. The scene captures two people talking in the foreground while other students sit further back, lost in their phones layers of presence and distraction happening all at once. In comparing shallow depth of field, deep focus, and Photoshopped blur, I learned that both clarity and softness carry a narrative, guiding the viewer’s attention and emotion. Working from an image I personally shot made every edit intentional, showing me that photography starts with noticing the details and ends with the creation of meaning from them, not taking it away.</p>
